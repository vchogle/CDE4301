        <h2> 1. Objective and Scope </h2>
        <p>
          By 2030, 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older, leading to an increase in geriatric patients requiring effective and timely medical care, particularly in dentistry (<i>ACTION PLAN FOR SUCCESSFUL AGEING 2023</i>, 2024). In geriatric dentistry, age-related factors and behaviors—such as care rejection, aggression, and agitation—can complicate treatment. Poor communication with elderly patients often results in diminished care quality and unsuccessful dental outcomes. The main issue addressed in this project is the limited exposure and communication training dentistry students receive when interacting with geriatric patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project aims to develop an innovative solution integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to create an AI-simulated patient. This solution will enhance the communication training of dentistry students by immersing them in a realistic dental office setting where they can interact with a 3D virtual patient displaying verbal and non-verbal cues. This report outlines the problem, functional requirements for the solution, progress made this semester, and a project plan to achieve the objectives by the end of CDE4301.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, a previous project involved students utilizing a platform with a virtual patient presented in a 2D format. However, this approach faced several challenges. The virtual patient platform is no longer in use, prompting the need for alternative solutions. Additionally, the 2D animated patient lacked the immersive experience required to effectively engage dentistry students. The large language model used in the project also struggled with providing accurate responses, underscoring the need for enhanced training data to improve its performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project addresses these limitations by introducing a virtual reality (VR) component, enabling students to interact with a 3D virtual patient within a realistic dental office environment. This immersive setting not only facilitates direct communication between the student and patient but also allows the student to interpret non-verbal cues, which are critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

        <h2>2. Context of Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The NUS Faculty of Dentistry currently employs SPs as part of its curriculum to improve students' communication skills. A standardized patient is an actor who has been meticulously trained to portray a real patient so convincingly that even a skilled clinician cannot distinguish the simulation from an actual patient encounter (Hillier et al., 2024). This hands-on approach allows dentistry students to practice their interpersonal and diagnostic skills in a controlled, simulated environment, preparing them for real-world scenarios.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while effective, this method has significant drawbacks. SPs are resource-intensive, requiring actors to be rigorously trained to simulate a wide range of conditions accurately. Coordinating SP sessions involves scheduling complexities, logistical constraints, and significant financial costs. Moreover, SP interactions are limited to specific scenarios, which can restrict the variety of patient behaviors and cases that students can experience. These limitations highlight the need for an alternative, scalable solution that maintains the benefits of SP-based training while addressing its resource-heavy nature.  
          This project focuses on improving communication training for dentistry students, with an emphasis on interactions with geriatric patients. Effective communication is critical in ensuring accurate diagnoses and successful treatment outcomes, particularly for older patients who may have complex medical and behavioral needs. By introducing an AI-simulated patient in a virtual reality (VR) environment, the project seeks to offer an immersive and diverse training experience that goes beyond what SPs can provide.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In the broader context, this project also aims to support the healthcare sector's response to Singapore's aging population. By equipping future dentists with advanced communication skills and experience interacting with geriatric patients, the initiative contributes to better dental care outcomes and improved quality of life for elderly individuals. Additionally, the adoption of AI and VR technology in educational training promotes innovation, potentially setting a precedent for other areas of healthcare education. Finally, reducing the reliance on SPs not only saves resources but also creates a scalable and adaptable training framework that can be expanded to cover a wider range of patient cases and scenarios in the future.

        <h2> 3. Value Proposition </h2>
        <p>
          To address the current state, I will develop an AI simulated patient in a virtual reality environment that provides dentistry students with immersive training, enabling them 
to effectively communicate with geriatric patients. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform will allow students to interact with various archetypes of elderly patients, exposing them to diverse personalities and communication styles. This exposure will better prepare students for real-life interactions in a safe and controlled setting. Additionally, it will reduce reliance on SPs, offering a more affordable, consistent, and accessible training solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, students will receive immediate, actionable feedback after each session, enabling them to refine their skills. By enhancing communication training, this platform will prepare future dentists to deliver compassionate, effective care to an aging population.

      <h2> 4. Project Goal </h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal is to conduct a user study in April 2025 with dentistry students during their communication with patients module using a fully functional prototype of the AI simulated patient. This study will evaluate whether an AI-simulated patient in a virtual reality environment is more effective for training communication skills compared to traditional SPs. By comparing these methods, the goal is to determine the most effective approach for enhancing students' ability to engage with geriatric patients. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To prepare for the study, I will secure all necessary approvals, ensuring ethical considerations around student participation are addressed. During this process, I will also finalize the study's methodology. In parallel, I will focus on developing a reliable, user-friendly prototype of the VR-based AI patient, conducting usability tests to ensure the platform is ready for student use and meets the desired effectiveness before the study begins.

    <h2> 5. Concept Development </h2>

    <div id="sub-section-5-header-1">
      <h3>5.1 Literature Review</h3>

      <p>
        To address the limitations of standardized patients, I began by conducting a literature review to explore current approaches for simulating these patient interactions using AI and large language models (also known as LLM). I examined several papers and selected one published before the introduction of LLMs and one published afterward.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the pre-LLM phase, a virtual patient named Julia was developed to address dental problems. An informal-language chatbot was designed to answer both clinical and non-clinical questions. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, 193 students engaged with the AI chatbot over several weeks to practice diagnosing clinical cases. However, this approach had its limitations. The chatbot technology did not allow dental students to directly interact with a patient, failing to simulate the appropriate clinical environment. Additionally, students expressed a preference for face-to-face interactions over using the chatbot, indicating a gap in the immersive experience (Suárez et al., 2022).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the post-LLM phase, the Furhat Robot was introduced as a more advanced virtual patient. It featured an animated face projected onto a translucent mask and supported multiple speech synthesis options, allowing it to adopt various identities, including different genders, ages, and ethnicities. The system was developed using the FurhatSDK and integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for conversational capabilities. Despite these advancements, limitations persisted. Users often experienced confusion when the robot heard their utterance but failed to respond immediately. Moreover, as a static robot, it lacked the ability to convey hand gestures or other non-verbal cues, which are essential components of human interaction (Borg et al., 2024).
      </p>

      <p>
        To develop an effective solution, I propose leveraging virtual reality (VR) to overcome the limitations identified in these studies. VR can provide an immersive environment for dentistry students, enabling them to interact directly with a 3D virtual patient that incorporates both verbal and non-verbal cues. This interaction would take place within a realistic simulation of a dentist's office, offering students a practical and engaging way to replicate real-life experiences.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="sub-section-5-header-2">
      <h3>5.2 Past Project</h3>
      <p>
        To develop this solution, past methodologies were examined, including a project conducted last year that introduced desktop simulation software to help dental students improve communication with virtual geriatric patients. The solution consisted of various modules, such as InteractAI as the platform for the virtual patient, Microsoft Azure for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities powered by neural networks, OpenAI GPT-3.5 for response generation, and OpenAI GPT-4.0 for post-conversation analysis. However, the solution faced several limitations. The virtual patient platform, InteractAI, is no longer in use, necessitating the exploration of alternative platforms. Additionally, the virtual patient was presented in 2D, which lacked the immersive environment needed to engage dentistry students effectively. Furthermore, the large language model required more accurate responses, highlighting the need for additional data to improve its training and performance.
      </p>
    </div>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-3">
        <h3>5.3 Functional Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          To develop my solution, I was introduced to key components through Aiden, a researcher in Prof. Khoo’s lab. The system consists of two main elements: the knowledge chatbot backend and the immersive 3D environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge chatbot backend, developed in Prof. Khoo’s lab, using Python, integrates OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini model. When a user inputs a patient description, the chatbot simulates a conversation with a virtual geriatric patient. However, for the chatbot to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses, it requires additional training. Currently, the system lacks sufficient patient archetypes, limiting its ability to offer varied and reliable interactions. Expanding the training data with diverse geriatric patient profiles will enhance the chatbot’s performance and make the conversations more realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create the immersive 3D environment, Unity 3D will be used as the platform for developing virtual reality applications. In this setting, students will engage with a virtual geriatric patient in a realistic dental office environment. I currently have access to an immersive training environment originally designed for cabin crew training using MetaQuest. To adapt this for dentistry training, I will modify the characters to represent geriatric patients and adjust the setting to reflect a dental office. This tailored environment will offer an engaging, patient-centered simulation that allows students to effectively practice their communication skills in a realistic context.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-4">
        <h3>5.4 Key Features</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the functional requirements, the concept design will focus on creating a VR-based geriatric patient and integrating a speech component to allow dentistry students to practice and refine their communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enhance this solution, I plan to incorporate the following features into the immersive environment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a dashboard in Python to provide analytics for the students to continually improve their skills - allowing for immediate and consistent feedback for their learning.</li>
          <li>Fine-tune the large language model (LLM) to deliver more accurate and contextually appropriate responses by incorporating additional data. This will be achieved through the inclusion of validated dentist-patient scripts provided by the Faculty of Dentistry.</li>
          <li>Create diverse geriatric patient archetypes, based on a template from the Faculty of Dentistry, to ensure a variety of interactions that reflect real-world scenarios.</li>

        <h2> 6. Current Progress on Deliverables </h2>
        <p>
          This semester, my primary focus has been on understanding the core problem, researching relevant literature, and gaining a deeper understanding of how the technology developed by the lab functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially met with Prof. Wong and Prof. Khoo in early September to clarify the project requirements and discuss the process for involving dental students in the user study. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout September and October, I held weekly meetings with Prof. Khoo and, later, Aiden to update them on my progress and gather feedback. I documented the meeting minutes in a spreadsheet, which allowed me to track next steps and clearly define the project deliverables.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November, I am focusing on developing a proof-of-concept prototype using the provided code to create a virtual geriatric patient and its environment. Additionally, I am working on finalizing the user study details by reviewing the protocol with both Prof. Khoo and Prof. Wong to ensure it meets the requirements for approval by the Departmental Ethics Review Committee (DERC).

        <h2> 7. Awareness of Shortcomings </h2>
        <p>
          This semester, I had faced a few challenges in my work that helped me to understand my strengths and weaknesses in this process. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, I faced a steep learning curve with Unity 3D, as I had no prior experience with the software. Using materials provided by Prof. Khoo and Aiden, I was able to familiarize myself with the application and grasp the nuances of the project. Additionally, while I had some experience with Python, I was unfamiliar with its use in the context of large language models (LLMs), which posed another challenge. To address these technical gaps, I will be taking online courses during the winter break to improve my coding skills and seeking assistance from my peers in Computer Science, as well as from Aiden in Prof. Khoo’s lab. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, as the code is primarily written for Windows, integrating it into my laptop has been a significant challenge. However, I am enjoying the process, as it forces me to deepen my understanding of Python and Unity 3D. To mitigate this issue, I plan to borrow a Windows laptop from the lab, which will minimize the need for excessive debugging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I was unsure of the direction to take in this project, which led to uncertainty on what I can achieve. To address this issue, I had regular meetings with Prof Khoo to update my progress. I plan to also ensure my doubts are clarified promptly, which I did hesitate towards the beginning of this semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, liaising with the Faculty of Dentistry to get information regarding the patient communication module took considerable time. To ensure more timely communication in the future, I plan to allocate adequate time for feedback, such as allowing up to two weeks for responses
