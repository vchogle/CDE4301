        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
          <p>By 2030, 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older, leading to an increase in geriatric patients requiring effective and timely medical care, particularly in dentistry (ACTION PLAN FOR SUCCESSFUL AGEING 2023, 2024). In geriatric dentistry, age-related factors and behaviors, such as care rejection, aggression, and agitation, can complicate treatment. Poor communication with elderly patients often results in diminished care quality and unsuccessful dental outcomes. The main issue addressed in this project is the limited exposure and communication training dentistry students receive when interacting with geriatric patients.</p>
          <p>This project aims to develop an innovative solution integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to create an AI-simulated patient. This solution will enhance the communication training of dentistry students by immersing them in a realistic dental office setting where they can interact with a 3D virtual patient. This report outlines the background and context of the problem, a review of related work, the development of the proposed concept, detailed design specifications, prototyping and implementation progress, system testing and evaluation, and a summary of how the key project deliverables have been fulfilled. It concludes with reflections on the project and recommendations for future work.</p>
          <p>In 2023, a previous project involved students utilizing a platform with a virtual patient presented in a 2D format. However, this approach faced several challenges. The virtual patient platform is no longer in use, prompting the need for alternative solutions. Additionally, the 2D animated patient lacked the immersive experience required to effectively engage dentistry students. The large language model used in the project also struggled with providing accurate responses, underscoring the need for enhanced training data to improve its performance.</p>
          <p>This project addresses these limitations by introducing a virtual reality (VR) component, enabling students to interact with a 3D virtual patient within a realistic dental office environment. This immersive setting enables direct, spoken interaction between the dental student and a simulated geriatric patient, allowing the student to practise communication strategies essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>

        <h2>2. Problem Definition and Context</h2>
        <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
          <h3>2.1 Problem Definition</h3>
          <p>The NUS Faculty of Dentistry currently employs SPs as part of its curriculum to improve students' communication skills. A standardized patient is an actor who has been meticulously trained to portray a real patient so convincingly that even a skilled clinician cannot distinguish the simulation from an actual patient encounter (Hillier et al., 2024). This hands-on approach allows dentistry students to practice their interpersonal and diagnostic skills in a controlled, simulated environment, preparing them for real-world scenarios. </p>

          <p>However, while effective, this method has significant drawbacks. SPs are resource-intensive, requiring actors to be rigorously trained to simulate a wide range of conditions accurately. Coordinating SP sessions involves scheduling complexities, logistical constraints, and significant financial costs. Moreover, SP interactions are limited to specific scenarios, which can restrict the variety of patient behaviors and cases that students can experience. These limitations highlight the need for an alternative, scalable solution that maintains the benefits of SP-based training while addressing its resource-heavy nature. </p> 
          
          <p>This project focuses on improving communication training for dentistry students, with an emphasis on interactions with geriatric patients. Effective communication is critical in ensuring accurate diagnoses and successful treatment outcomes, particularly for older patients who may have complex medical and behavioral needs. By introducing an AI-simulated patient in a virtual reality (VR) environment, the project seeks to offer an immersive and diverse training experience that goes beyond what SPs can provide.  </p>
          
          <p>In the broader context, this project also aims to support the healthcare sector's response to Singapore's aging population. By equipping future dentists with advanced communication skills and experience interacting with geriatric patients, the initiative contributes to better dental care outcomes and improved quality of life for elderly individuals. Additionally, the adoption of AI and VR technology in educational training promotes innovation, potentially setting a precedent for other areas of healthcare education. Finally, reducing the reliance on SPs not only saves resources but also creates a scalable and adaptable training framework that can be expanded to cover a wider range of patient cases and scenarios in the future.</p>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2 Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>To address the current state in dental education, this project introduces an AI-simulated patient in a virtual reality environment designed to provide dentistry students with immersive communication training focused on geriatric care.</p>
        <p>The platform enables students to engage in realistic, voice-based conversations with an elderly patient within a fully immersive dental clinic setting. This approach creates a safe and controlled environment where students can build confidence and refine their interpersonal skills, particularly when navigating the complexities of age-related behaviors and communication barriers.</p>
        <p>By offering consistent and repeatable training experiences, the solution reduces reliance on standardized patients, making communication training more scalable, cost-effective, and accessible across institutions.</p>
        <p>Through realistic interactions, this platform equips future dentists with the empathy, adaptability, and communication proficiency needed to deliver effective and compassionate care to an aging population.</p>

        <h2> 3. Literature Review and Context </h2>
        <div id="sub-section-3-header-1">
          <h3>3.1 Literature Review</h3> 
          <p>To address the limitations of standardized patients, I began by conducting a literature review to explore current approaches for simulating these patient interactions using AI and large language models (also known as LLM). I examined several papers and selected one published before the introduction of LLMs and one published afterward.</p>
          <p>In the pre-LLM phase, a virtual patient named Julia was developed to address dental problems. An informal-language chatbot was designed to answer both clinical and non-clinical questions. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, 193 students engaged with the AI chatbot over several weeks to practice diagnosing clinical cases. However, this approach had its limitations. The chatbot technology did not allow dental students to directly interact with a patient, failing to simulate the appropriate clinical environment. Additionally, students expressed a preference for face-to-face interactions over using the chatbot, indicating a gap in the immersive experience (Su√°rez et al., 2022).</p>
          <p>In the post-LLM phase, the Furhat Robot was introduced as a more advanced virtual patient. It featured an animated face projected onto a translucent mask and supported multiple speech synthesis options, allowing it to adopt various identities, including different genders, ages, and ethnicities. The system was developed using the FurhatSDK and integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for conversational capabilities. Despite these advancements, limitations persisted. Users often experienced confusion when the robot heard their utterance but failed to respond immediately. Moreover, as a static robot, it lacked the ability to convey hand gestures or other non-verbal cues, which are essential components of human interaction (Borg et al., 2024).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sub-section-3-header-2">
          <h3>3.2 Past Project</h3> 
          <p>To develop this solution, past methodologies were examined, including a project conducted last year that introduced desktop simulation software to help dental students improve communication with virtual geriatric patients. The solution consisted of various modules, such as InteractAI as the platform for the virtual patient, Microsoft Azure for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities powered by neural networks, OpenAI GPT-3.5 for response generation, and OpenAI GPT-4.0 for post-conversation analysis. However, the solution faced several limitations. The virtual patient platform, InteractAI, is no longer in use, necessitating the exploration of alternative platforms. Additionally, the virtual patient was presented in 2D, which lacked the immersive environment needed to engage dentistry students effectively. Furthermore, the large language model required more accurate responses, highlighting the need for additional data to improve its training and performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sub-section-3-header-3">
          <h3>3.3 Key Insights Behind Concept Development</h3>
          <p>The literature and related work shaped the direction of this project significantly. Reviewing both pre- and post-LLM virtual patient systems, it became clear that earlier chatbot-based platforms helped lay the groundwork but lacked the realism and interactivity needed for clinical communication training. For instance, the Julia chatbot (Su√°rez et al., 2022) allowed students to engage with simple case prompts via text, but the absence of embodiment and spoken dialogue reduced authenticity and engagement.</p>
          <p>Newer systems like the Furhat Robot (Borg et al., 2024) introduced more advanced interaction using animated faces and GPT-3.5 integration. However, they still had limitations such as response delays, limited expressiveness, and a static physical setup. These issues showed that while LLMs had improved, they needed a more immersive and emotionally rich platform to be effective in education.</p> 
          <p>Separately, past project work with InteractAI, Azure speech tools, and 2D simulations highlighted the same problem. Students lost interest without a strong sense of presence. The flat 2D environment and lack of embodied behavior made it difficult to simulate emotional or cognitive conditions like dementia. Early prompt testing also revealed that LLMs require domain-specific tuning to stay consistent in character over time.</p>
          <p>Together, these findings pointed to the need for a system that combines immersive realism, expressive communication, and LLM adaptability. This directly shaped the decision to build a VR-based platform powered by GPT-4o, hosted in a 3D clinical setting with simulated patient personas. It became clear that effective communication training needs more than just conversation. Emotional tone and memory-driven behavior are essential for creating a realistic and educationally meaningful experience.</p>

      <h2> 4. Concept Development </h2>
      <div id="sub-section-4-header-1">
        <h3>4.1 Design Rationale and System Goals</h3> 
        <p>This project started from a clear gap in how dental students are trained to communicate with older patients, especially those showing signs of cognitive decline. While standardized patients offer useful exposure, they are often limited in availability, consistency, and cost. Similarly, most existing digital tools do not provide emotionally realistic interactions or a convincing clinical environment. The main goal of this system is to simulate a realistic, responsive geriatric patient who can engage students in meaningful conversations. This includes presenting challenges commonly seen in older patients, such as forgetfulness, anxiety, or confusion, and encouraging students to adapt their tone, phrasing, and empathy accordingly.</p>
        <p>My aim was to create a learning tool that combines conversational AI with virtual reality in a way that feels lifelike and educational. I wanted students to be able to speak naturally to a virtual patient, receive emotionally appropriate responses, and feel as though they were in an actual dental consultation. Rather than just building another chatbot, the system is designed to simulate a full dental visit with a believable elderly character who has their own personality, backstory, and cognitive challenges.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sub-section-4-header-2">
        <h3>4.2 Exploration of Concept Alternatives</h3> 
        <p>During the early design phase, I explored multiple directions for the system. One of the first key decisions was choosing the platform: web, desktop, or VR. While web-based and desktop solutions were more accessible and technically straightforward, they lacked the level of immersion needed for realistic training. Previous projects using 2D virtual patients, such as those built on InteractAI, mostly involved typing and reading text, which did not reflect how actual dental consultations take place.</p>
        <p>After discussions with the Immersive Reality Lab, I decided to pursue a VR-based approach. VR provided a stronger sense of presence by situating students in a simulated clinic environment, making it easier to support authentic communication training.</p>
        <p>For the patient design, I experimented with a range of geriatric personas, including a cooperative elderly patient, one who appeared more anxious, and one exhibiting early signs of dementia. Testing these different archetypes helped clarify how each would require unique prompting strategies, emotional expressions, and memory behavior. I also compared scripted dialogue trees with open-ended conversations powered by large language models. The natural flow and adaptability of LLMs made them a better fit for simulating complex, real-time communication scenarios.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sub-section-4-header-3">
        <h3>4.3 Justification for Final Concept Direction</h3> 
        <p>After testing initial versions using the VR system developed for cabin crew training and reviewing feedback from previous projects, I committed to a VR-based concept powered by a large language model. Using GPT-4o mini allows the virtual patient to respond in a way that feels emotionally aware and naturally conversational. This was important for simulating geriatric patients who may struggle with memory, repeat themselves, or display shifts in mood. These are moments where students need to respond with empathy, and the system is designed to support that learning experience.</p>
        <p>VR was chosen to provide a fully immersive environment where students can practise not just verbal communication, but also situational awareness and emotional presence. While the focus of this iteration is on conversation, the 3D clinical setting adds depth and realism to the experience. It helps students feel like they are in a real dental consultation, with the opportunity to adjust their responses based on how the patient is behaving or reacting.</p>
        <p>In summary, this concept was selected because it strikes the right balance between realism, flexibility, and educational value. It supports scalable and repeatable training without losing the human complexity that is often missing from traditional tools. With a foundation built on GPT-4o, Unity 3D, and validated communication scripts, the system can be expanded in the future to include more patient profiles, feedback tools, or adaptive difficulty based on performance.</p>

    <h2> 5. Design Specifications </h2>

    <div id="sub-section-5-header-1">
      <h3>5.1 Functional Requirements</h3>
      <p>The solution is designed to simulate realistic communication between dentistry students and elderly patients through the integration of AI and virtual reality. Students should be able to speak naturally to the virtual patient using a microphone, while the AI responds using spoken dialogue generated by a large language model and delivered via a text-to-speech engine. These interactions must take place within a realistic dental scenario, with the system maintaining context and expressing appropriate emotional tones. The VR environment should resemble an actual dental clinic to help students build familiarity with a professional treatment setting. The system should also be able to simulate a range of communication styles, such as cooperative, confused, or anxious patients, to reflect real-world diversity. After each session, students should receive structured feedback aligned with communication assessment rubrics, covering aspects like clarity, empathy, and the use of follow-up questions. The virtual patient should also exhibit non-verbal behaviors, such as facial expressions or hesitation, to further reinforce realistic communication.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub-section-5-header-2">
      <h3>5.2 Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
      <p>In addition to core features, the system must meet several non-functional expectations. Low latency is essential. AI responses should ideally occur within two seconds to maintain natural conversation flow. The platform should also be scalable, allowing future integration of new patient profiles and training scenarios. The AI must remain in character and follow a structured conversational flow, especially for sensitive personas like Shibing, who simulates dementia. Usability is another key consideration; students should be able to use the system without extensive onboarding, and the VR experience should be smooth and intuitive. Finally, reliability is critical. The system must run consistently during sessions without crashing or interrupting the training process.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="sub-section-5-header-3">
      <h3>5.3 Technical Constraints and Assumptions</h3>
      <p>The system is built using Unity 3D and deployed on MetaQuest VR headsets. AI responses are powered by the GPT-4o mini model, accessed via API, which requires a stable internet connection for reliable performance. The original codebase provided was optimized for Windows, so early development included resolving compatibility issues across platforms. The AI training data is based on validated dentist-patient communication scripts provided by the Faculty of Dentistry. This version of the prototype assumes that users have basic familiarity with conversational English and are comfortable using standard VR controls.</p>

      <div id="section-header-6">
        <h2> 6. System Architecture </h2>
        <p>The system architecture of the virtual patient training environment is organized into two primary components: a Python-based backend that manages AI-driven dialogue and behavioral logic, and a Unity-based frontend that presents the immersive VR experience. These components are integrated via a WebSocket communication interface, enabling seamless real-time conversations between the dental student and the AI-simulated patient.</p>
        <div id="sub-section-6-header-1">
          <h3>6.1 Backend (Python)</h3>
          <p>The backend is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, enabling swift iteration of behavior scripts, patient personas, and interaction pipelines. It includes the following core modules:</p>
          <p>This backend is lightweight and portable, supporting deployment both on a local workstation and cloud servers. Patient behavior and speech style can be customized by modifying prompt templates and fallback logic, making the system easily adaptable for simulating other patient archetypes (e.g., anxious, stoic, uncooperative).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sub-section-6-header-2">
          <h3>6.2 Frontend (Unity 3D)</h3>

        <div id="sub-section-6-header-3">
          <h3>6.3 Communication Workflow</h3>
          <p>The complete interaction pipeline follows this sequence:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The student speaks to the virtual patient through the VR headset.</li>
            <li>Unity records the audio, sends it to Azure STT, and transmits the transcript to the Python backend.</li>
            <li>The backend formats the input with patient-specific behaviors and sends a prompt to GPT-4o.</li>
            <li>GPT-4o generates a response, which is returned as text.</li>
            <li>The backend converts the response into audio using Azure TTS and sends it to Unity.</li>
